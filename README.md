# My First Webpage!

## Welcome to my first webpage

This webpage is created as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Web Devoloper Program.
The webpage shows the different subjects and coding languages that I'll be learning during course:

* HTML5 (is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.)
* CSS (is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.)
* JavaScript (enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.)
* Python (a interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.)
* MySQL (is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS.))
* Flask (is a micro web framework written in Python.)
* MongoDB (is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.)
* Django (is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern.)
* Heroku (is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages.)
* Git (is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.)
* GitHub (is a global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.)
* Cloud9 IDE (is an Online IDE (integrated development environment.)
